# Contribution Guidelines

- **To add to the tables:** Submit a pull request
- **To remove from the tables:** Open an issue

`awesome-lipidomics` are a collection of hand-crafted tables for lipidomics workflow tools and resources.

- Table items should be sorted *alphabetically* by name and classification / workflow.
- Each item should be limited to at most two links: a) PUBMED link and b) main website to access sourcecode or the tool.
- Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional.
- Descriptions should follow the table structure and existing columns.

Please contribute links to packages/projects you have used or are familiar with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.

## Quality standard

To stay in the tables, package repositories should adhere to these quality standards:

- Generally useful to the community.
- Functional.
- Actively maintained (even if that just means acknowledging open issues when they arise) or at least still available.
- Unavailable tools will be marked.
- Stable, or progressing toward stable.
